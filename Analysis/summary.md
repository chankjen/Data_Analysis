### **How to Use summary_analysis.py File**

1. Save the code in a file named `summary_analysis.py`.
2. Ensure the datasets (`beverages.xlsx` and `fruits.csv`) are in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using Python:

   python summary_analysis.py
   ```
4. The script will:
   - Print basic analysis results to the console.
   - Display histograms and pie charts using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
   - Open the 3D mesh chart in your default web browser.
